name: rollout
description: Land a merged kit change to template/ or scripts/sync.sh in every extension beside the kit - sync.sh into each, review, make check, then each extension's own issue, branch, pull request, green CI and squash merge - until sync.sh --check is clean for all. Use after a kit pull request that changes what the extensions carry has been merged.
argument-hint: "[extension names or aliases; default every extension in extensions.json]"

Roll out to: $ARGUMENTS (nothing given: every extension `extensions.json` lists)

This runs in a session started in the kit folder; it is the kit's own skill, not the
plugin's. The extensions' `main` is protected, so a template change reaches them only as
one pull request each, through the loop their CLAUDE.md describes.

## Before

- The kit change is **merged**, and the kit checkout is on `main`, pulled. Never roll out
  from a branch: the extensions would carry files that `main` does not have.
- `scripts/sync.sh --check` lists what differs per extension. An extension already up to
  date needs nothing. One that `sync.sh` refuses (its `.gitignore` ignores a synced file)
  gets that fixed in the same pull request.
- `scripts/pull.sh` brings every extension's checkout up to date (and clones a missing
  one). One it leaves alone (work in progress, another session's branch, uncommitted
  changes) is not rolled out to: name it in the report.

## Each extension

1. `gh issue create`: "Carry the kit's <what changed>", linking the kit pull request.
2. A branch `chore/kit-sync-<short-name>` from a fresh `main`.
3. `scripts/sync.sh <extension>` from the kit. Read the whole diff
   (`git -C <extension> diff`, and `git -C <extension> status` for new files): only the
   synced files change, and each change is the kit's. A file the extension had changed
   by hand is a finding for the report, not something to keep or drop silently.
4. Whatever the change needs that `sync.sh` cannot do: a new package in
   `./.github/ci-packages`, a line in the extension's CLAUDE.md that the template now
   contradicts. An extension without `./scripts/ext.conf` is moving onto the shared
   scripts for the first time: `nested-migration.md`, beside this skill, says what moves
   where and how to verify it. Nothing else goes in: a rollout pull request never carries
   other work.
5. `make check` in the extension.
6. Commit (subject says what is now true: "CI caches the npm modules, as the kit's
   template does now"), push, open the pull request with "Fixes #N" and a link to the kit
   pull request, wait for the `make check` job to go green, then
   `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`, check `main`'s run and pull `main`.

With more than two extensions, give each one to a subagent with these steps and the kit
pull request's link; they touch separate repositories, so they run in parallel. Two
agents never work in the same extension at once.

## After

- `scripts/sync.sh --check` is clean for every extension (`up to date` each).
- When the rollout brought `.github/workflows/release.yml` to an extension for the first
  time, run `scripts/protect-tags.sh <extension>` once its pull request has merged, so its
  release tags can never be moved or deleted; `scripts/releases.sh` then shows its
  `release run` as `never run` rather than `no workflow`.
- Report: the kit pull request, one line per extension (its pull request and CI, or why it
  was skipped), and anything an extension had changed by hand in a synced file.
